## Details 
`generate_data_list`

* `model.py` : The two Machine Learning models(MLP and modified LeNet) for implementing all algorithms
* `make_envs.py` : The file loads dataset and makes a list containing data from different environments
* `main.py` : The whole framework of training process using different algorithms for out of distribution problems
* `sampling_bias_demo.ipynb` : The demo of creating data distrbution dataset caused by sampling bias
* `evaluation.py` : code for evaluating the trained model on test environments
