The experiments use the following dataset. The datasets contains six benchmark out of distirbution datasets specifically for regression problems in mechanics.  
- [Mechanical MNIST â€“ Distribution Shift](https://open.bu.edu/handle/2144/44485)


## Details 

* 'model.py' : The two Machine Learning models(MLP and modified LeNet) for implementing all algorithms
* 'make_envs.py' : The file loads dataset and makes a list containing data from different environments
* 'main.py' : The whole framework of training process using different algorithms for out of distribution problems
* 'sampling_bias_demo.ipynb' :
* 'evaluation.py' :+
